zfs_rolling_sync.sh is a simple script to *pull* a ZFS repository periodically, using
incremental snapshots.

It has been designed to be simple and robust.  Before I had written a
semi-bloated script that tried to be very versatile and do too many things at
once.  It ended up not being robust at all and difficult to fix.

The bootstrap has to be done manually, but zfs_rolling_sync.sh will just give you the
right command to run, so you just have to copy/paste.  Basically, run the command twice
manually (once to create the remote snapshot, once to do the initial synchronization).

Then you can add the following to your crontab(5), the lockf(1) command is used to
prevent long runs from stepping on each other (example taken from FreeBSD, YMMV)"
